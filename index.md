# The OpenAstrodynamics Intiative

**OpenAstrodynamics** is a collaboration between open source astrodynamics and space engineering projects to share resources, ideas, and to improve code.

## Core Principles

We believe in...

* Interoperability through open standards and protocols
* Sharing validated algorithms
* Contributing test cases and reference scenarios
* Diversity in implementations and technologies

## Members

* **[Astrodynamics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAstrodynamics/Astrodynamics.jl)** is an MPLv2-licensed framework for building astrodynamics applications in Julia.
* **[openastro](https://github.com/openastro)** is collection of C++ libraries for astrodynamics and space engineering.
* **[poliastro](http://poliastro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** is a python package for Astrodynamics and Orbital Mechanics problems, such as orbital elements conversion, orbital propagation, plotting, planetary ephemerides computation, and more.
